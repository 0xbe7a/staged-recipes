  summary: 'OS-independent wrapper for shlex and mslex'
  description: |
    oslex is an OS-independent wrapper for shlex and mslex.
    Its main purpose is to provide functions similar in functionality
    to shlex.quote(), shlex.split() and shlex.join() on both Windows
    and POSIX-compatible platforms.

    This goal is achieved by simply forwarding the calls to either shlex
    (from the standard library) on POSIX-compatible systems, or the excellent
    mslex library (written by Lawrence D'Anna / @smoofra) on Windows.
  
    In other words, oslex is to shlex/mslex what os-path is to posixpath/ntpath.
