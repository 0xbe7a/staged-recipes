  summary: 'Simulate the performance of structural and geotechnical systems 
     subjected to earthquakes'
  description: |
    OpenSees is a software framework for developing applications
     to simulate the performance of structural and geotechnical systems 
     subjected to earthquakes. 
     The goal of the OpenSees development is to improve the modeling 
     and computational simulation in earthquake engineering 
     through open-source development.
     The development of OpenSees was sponsored by 
     the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center.
