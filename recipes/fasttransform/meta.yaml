  summary: "Transform is the main building block of data pipelines in fastai. And elsewhere if you want."
  description: |
    Transform is a class that lets you create reusable data transformations.
    You initialize a Transform by passing in or decorating a raw function.
    The Transform then provides an enhanced version of that function via
    Transform.encodes, which can be used in your data pipeline.

    It provides various conveniences:
    - Reversibility. You can collect the raw function and its inverse into one transform object.
    - Customized initialization. You can customize the exact behavior of a transform function on initialization.
    - Type-based multiple dispatch. Transforms can specialize their behavior based on the runtime types of their arguments.
    - Type conversion/preservation. Transforms help you maintain desired return types.
