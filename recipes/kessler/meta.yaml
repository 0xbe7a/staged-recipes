  summary: 'Simulation-based inference and machine learning for space collision assessment and avoidance..'
  description: |
    *kessler* is a Python package for simulation-based inference and machine learning 
    for space collision avoidance and assessment. It is named in honor of NASA scientist
    Donald J. Kessler known for his studies regarding space debris and proposing the  
    Kessler syndrome. The package has the capability to parse, analyze and plot conjunction data
    messages (CDMs) in their original format. It also offers a machine learning module to train
    recurrent neural network and predict CDMs. Finally, it has a simulation-based inference component
    where a full probabilistic simulator can be used to simulate synthetic CDMs and perform inference over observed data.
