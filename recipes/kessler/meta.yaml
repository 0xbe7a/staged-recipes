  summary: 'Machine learning and simulation-based inference for space collision assessment and avoidance.'
  description: |
    *kessler* is a Python package for simulation-based inference and machine learning 
    for space collision avoidance and assessment. It is named in honor of NASA scientist
    Donald J. Kessler known for his studies regarding space debris and proposing the  
    Kessler syndrome. The package can parse, analyze, and plot conjunction data
    messages (CDMs), offers tools for training recurrent neural networks to predict CDMs, 
    and includes a simulator to generate synthetic CDMs and perform inference over observed data.
