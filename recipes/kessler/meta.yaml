  summary: 'Simulation-based inference and machine learning for space collision assessment and avoidance.' 
  description: |
    *kessler* is a Python package for simulation-based inference and machine learning
    for space collision avoidance and assessment. It is named in honour of NASA scientist [Donald J. 
Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler),
    who first proposed the [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) in 1978.
    The package offers the possibility to parse, analyze and plot conjunction data messages (CDMs) in their original format.
    It also features a machine learning module that offers recurrent neural network (RNN) models for predicting the evolution of the
    CDMs, as well as a probabilistic program emulating the entire CDM generation process, which can be used to 
    simulate CDMs and perform simulation-based inference.
