  summary: BDSIM is a code to make 3D models of particle accelerators using Geant4.
  description: |
    Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM) is a C++ program that utilises the Geant4 toolkit to simulate
    both the transport of particles in an accelerator and their interaction with the accelerator
    material. BDSIM is capable of simulating a wide variety of accelerator components and magnets
    with Geant4 geometry dynamically built based on a text input file. Thick lens accelerator
    tracking routines are provided for fast accurate tracking in a vacuum.
