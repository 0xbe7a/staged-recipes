  summary: 'Re-registration of xlwt for pandas'
  description: |
    As the xlwt package is no longer maintained, the xlwt engine of pandas was removed.
    But there are some legacy APIs that still only support older MS Excel 97/2000/XP/2003 XLS files.
    This module contains xlwt engine copied from pandas v1.5.3 and re-registers it when you import pandas_xlwt, eventually allow pandas versions above 2.0.0 output xls format file.
