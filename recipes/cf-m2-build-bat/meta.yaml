  summary:  Use m2-* environment in conda build on win-64 host
  description: |
    This package provides some scripts that allow trampolining from
    CMD to an MSYS2 environment on the build or test environment of
    a conda build run.  The test case is a simple conda build recipe
    using the trampolines during the build and test phases, and
    serves as an example of its usage.
