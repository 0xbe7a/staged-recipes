  summary: "KITE: K-mer Index Tversky Estimator application"
  description: |
    KITE is a Java application that detects pathogens within samples.
    It can be used for DNA and/or RNA FASTQ files.
    KITE stands for K-mer Index Tversky Estimator, as the application leverages
    k-mer analysis combined with the Tversky index.
    KITE not only expedites viral detection but also maintains comparable
    sensitivity to existing approaches.
