  summary: 'A library for stochastic simulation reproducibility'
  description: |
    libSSR is an open-source software library designed to enhance the reproducibility of stochastic simulations. 
    libSSR provides tools that help researchers and developers ensure that their stochastic models yield consistent 
    and verifiable results across different runs and environments. This capability delivers critical reproducibility 
    for validation and peer review in computational domains where randomness plays a central role.
